<h2 id="uto-sci">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</h2>
<h3>General Introduction and the History of Materialism</h3>
<p>In 1875, Eugen Dühring converted to socialism and presented his own socialist
theory to the German public. His theory was pointedly anti-Marxist. At the same
time, the two sections of the German socialist party (the Eisenachres and
Lasalleans) had joined together, thereby strengthening the party. Dühring formed
a new sect around him with the intent of forming a separate party. As was often
typical for German theorists, he made immense attempts to justify his system
philosophically and logically, and published three enormous volumes presenting
the results of these attempts. Engels set about to form a critique of Dühring in
defence of Marx; due to the systematic nature of Dühring's work, this allowed
Engels to present Marx in a newly systematic manner. This critique was published
as <i>Anti-Dühring: Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science</i>. Three
chapters of this pamphlet were then published as the present text: <i>Socialism:
Utopian and Scientific</i>.</p>

<p>All the terminology in this work corresponds with that used in the English
edition of <i>Capital</i>. For instance, 'production of commodities' refers to
the economic phase where items are produced not only for the <i>use of their
producers</i>, but also for the <i>purpose of exchange</i>. This phase continues
to this day, and reached its full development only in capitalist production,
i.e. in conditions where a capitalist (an owner of the means of production)
employs labourers (people deprived of the means of production with the exception
of their labour-power) for wages, and keeps the profits made from selling the
products.</p>

<p>The history of industrial production since the Middle Ages can be split into
three periods:
<ul>
  <li><i>Handicraft</i>: master crafters have a few apprentices; each labourer
  produces a complete product.</li>
  <li><i>Manufacture</i>: larger numbers of workers are collected in one
  establishment and work together to produce a complete product, according to
  the division of labour – the product is only finished when it has passed
  through each worker's hands.</li>
  <li><i>Modern industry</i>: the product is created by machinery driven by
  power; the worker is limited to correcting and supervising the machines'
  performance.</li>
</ul><p>

<p>This work will defend <b>historical materialism</b>, which 'grates upon the
ears of the immense majority of British readers'. However, Engels argues,
England itself (from the 17th century onwards) is the home of modern
materialism:</p>

<blockquote>
  "The real progenitor of English materialism is Bacon. To him, natural
  philosophy is the only true philosophy, and physics based upon the experience
  of the senses is the chiefest part of natural philosophy. Anaxagoras and his
  homoiomeriae, Democritus and his atoms, he often quotes as his authorities.
  According to him, the senses are infallible and the source of all knowledge.
  All science is based on experience, and consists in subjecting the data
  furnished by the senses to a rational method of investigation. Induction,
  analysis, comparison, observation, experiment, are the principal forms of such
  a rational method." <b>(Marx, <i>The Holy Family)</i></b>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, Marx saw England to be the origin of modern materialism – in Bacon,
Hobbes, and Locke.</p>

<p>In the middle of the 19th century, every foreigner who moved into England was
taken aback by what seemed to be 'the religious bigotry and stupidity of the
Egnlish respectable middle-class'. Continental Europeans at the time were
materialists ('or, at least, very advanced free-thinkers'), and as such it
seemed unimaginable that educated English people should believe in the miracles
of the book of Genesis, and so on. It was amongst the uneducated – 'the "great
unwashed", as they were then called, the working people' – where you could find
people actually exercising their intellects.</p>

<p>After this period, England became 'civilised'. The <i>Great Exhibition</i>
marked the end of English insularity. The country became more internationalised,
and this came along with a spread of Continental skepticism towards religious
issues. According to Engels, this agnosticism should be seen as predictable,
following the fact that materialism dawned in England: 'What, indeed, is
agnosticism but, to use an expressive Lancashire term, "shamefaced"
materialism?' Agnosticism implies a materialistic conception of nature: the
natural world is governed by law, and erases the possibility of supernatural
intervention. But the <i>agnostic</i> also claims taht we have no means of
proving nor disproving the existence of a god. Following the establishing of the
evolutionary conception of the universe, however, there is 'no room for either a
Creator or a Ruler'; any god that is still postulated, by being moved outside of
the existing world, is just a contradictory idea.</p>

<p>The agnostic also claims that, while knowledge is based upon the information
we gain from our senses, there is no way to know that this information is
genuinely reliable and accurate. This argumentation seems very difficult to
defeat; however, 'before there was argumentation, there was action': Engels
claims that, when we act towards objects in a way that corresponds with our
perception of them, we prove the correctness of our perception. 'The proof of
the pudding is in the eating'. Our activity can prove or disprove the validity
of any particular sense-perception we have.</p>

<p>A 'neo-Kantian agnostic' will claim that, although we correctly perceive the
qualities of an object, the thing in itself is beyond our knowledge entirely.
But in response to this, Hegel has replied that <i>knowing all the qualities of
a thing</i> actually amounts to <i>knowing the thing itself</i>. Furthermore,
the scientific knowledge in Kant's time doesn't compare to the scientific
knowledge a century later; at any stage of scientific understanding, it is easy
and tempting to unify and label all that is unknown about the objects of
scientific understanding as 'the thing in itself'.</p>

<p>Now, while the agnostic will make these reservations <i>in abstracto</i>, any
challenge to them will reveal that they do not hold the reservations <i>in
concreto</i>. The typical agnostic claim is that, <i>'as far as we are
concerned'</i>, there is no supernatural being, the world is governed by
unchanging laws, and so on. As far as the agnostic's actual beliefs go,
regardless of their theoretical posturing, they are a materialist. As such, it
is not only the case that the British dismissal of historical materialism is
unreasonable; it may be the case that historical materialism can be of advantage
to 'British respectability'.</p>

<h3>I. The Development of Utopian Socialism</h3>
<p>At its core, modern socialism is the product of (a) recognising the class
antagonisms between capitalists and wage-workers, and (b) recognising the chaos
existing in production. In its theoretical form, however, modern socialism seems
to be a logical extension of the philosophers of the 18th century in France.
Like all new theories, modern socialism had to connect itself with the
popular intellectual discourse of its time, regardless of how already connected
it was with actual material facts.</p>

<p>The aforementioned French philosophers were revolutionaries. They recognised
no external authority and, in doing so, submit religion, science, society, and
politics to unflinching criticism. Reason became the judge of everything. As
Hegel described it, 'the world stood upon its head'; this was true in two
senses. First, the human head and its faculty of reason became the basis of all
action and organisation; secondly, and more widely, everything that was in
contradiction to this faculty had to be revolutionised: to be turned upside
down.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the late 19th century, this 'kingdom of reason' can be
seen as merely the 'idealised kingdom of the bourgeoisie'. Reason's 'eternal
right' found itself manifested as bourgeois justice; rational 'equality' was
reduced to mere equality before the law. The government of reason and Rousseau's
<i>social contract</i> could only come to fruition in democratic bourgeois
republics, such were the limitations of that era.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, while these antagonisms between feudal nobility and bourgeoisie
were challenged, the more general antagonism between exploiters and exploited
– between rich property-owners and poor workers. It was actually <i>this</i>
antagonism that produced the suffering which the bourgeois philosophers
themselves claimed to represent. Here we see that, from its birth, the
bourgeoisie cannot exist without wage workers. It was these wage-workers that
became the proletariat. During every bourgeois uprising, independent outbursts
of proletarians (or the general wage-workers that made up their predecessors)
took place. For instance, the English Revolution saw the independent uprising of
the Levellers; the French Revolution saw the agitation of Babeuf.</p>

<p>When these proto-proletarian uprisings took place, they aimed for utopian
social conditions (in the 16th and 17th centuries) or actual communistic
conditions (in the 18th century). The theorists of these uprisings demanded
equality in a wider sense than the bourgeois philosophers: equality did not just
refer to political rights, but to social conditions. Class <i>distinctions</i>
were to be dissolved along with class privileges.</p>

<p>Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen all stood for such utopian socialism, calling
for the removal of class distinction. However, one shortcoming is common to them
all: they all failed to work towards the emancipation of a <i>particular
class</i> (namely, the proletariat), and instead claimed to stand for the
liberation of all humanity at once. In this sense, they stood with the bourgeois
French philosophers in wanting to establish a kingdom of eternal reason and
justice; they simply saw themselves as distanced from these philosophers.</p>

<p>The French philosophers of bourgeois revolution appealed to reason as the
judge of everything, but this sense of reason was merely the idealised
understanding of an 18th century citizen. The French Revolution realised the
society that was designed off of the principles of this idealised understanding.
Rousseau's social contract was manifested as the Reign of Terror in which the
bourgeoisie took refuge from the corrupt Directorate. This Reign, in turn, gave
way to Napoleonic despotism. The promise of eternal peace was matched with a
seemingly eternal war. Crime increased from year to year; bourgeois vices
replaced feudal vices; trade became riddled with cheating; the revolutionary
spirit of <i>fraternité</i> manifested itself as rivalries in constant
competitive battles.</p>
